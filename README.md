# D-Link HNAP

A [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) custom integration for D-Link sensors using the HNAP protocol.

**Key features:**

- **100% local** — communicates directly with devices on your network, no cloud or internet required
- **UI configurable** — full config flow with step-by-step setup from the Home Assistant UI
- **Auto-discovery** — automatically finds D-Link devices on your network via SSDP
- **Automatic capability detection** — probes the device and creates only the entities it supports
- **Configurable options** — adjust polling interval and motion timeout from the UI without restarting
- **Device info** — registers devices with manufacturer, model, firmware version, and hardware version
- **Diagnostics** — built-in diagnostics download with automatic redaction of sensitive data
- **YAML migration** — legacy YAML configurations are automatically imported as config entries

## Supported Devices

| Device | Model | Capabilities |
| ------ | ----- | ------------ |
| Motion Sensor | DCH-S150 | Motion detection |
| Water Leakage Sensor | DCH-S160, DCH-S161 | Water detection, Temperature |

Other D-Link HNAP-compatible devices may also work. The integration automatically detects which capabilities a device supports by querying its available SOAP actions.

## Entities

The integration auto-creates entities based on device capabilities:

| Entity | Type | Device Class | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Water Detected | Binary Sensor | `moisture` | `on` when water is detected. Only created for devices with water detection capability. |
| Motion Detected | Binary Sensor | `motion` | `on` when motion is detected, turns `off` after the configured motion timeout. Only created for devices with motion detection capability. |
| Temperature | Sensor | `temperature` | Current temperature reading in °C. Only created for devices that report temperature. |
| Firmware Version | Sensor | *(diagnostic)* | Reports the device firmware version. Always created for all devices. |

All entities are associated with a **device** in the Home Assistant device registry, showing manufacturer (D-Link), model, firmware version, and hardware version.

## Installation

### HACS _(preferred method)_

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Search for **D-Link HNAP** in the Integrations section
3. Click **Download**
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual install

1. Copy the `custom_components/dlink_hnap` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### UI Setup (recommended)

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration** (bottom right)
3. Search for **D-Link HNAP**
4. Fill in the connection details:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Host** | IP address or hostname of the D-Link device (e.g. `192.168.1.50`) |
| **Username** | Authentication username — almost always `Admin` (pre-filled) |
| **Password** | The PIN code printed on the device label |

5. Click **Submit** — the integration will connect to the device, verify credentials, and detect capabilities
6. Entities are created automatically based on what the device supports

> **Tip:** The PIN code is typically printed on a label on the back or bottom of the device.

### SSDP Auto-Discovery

If a D-Link device is on your local network, Home Assistant will automatically discover it via SSDP. When discovered:

1. A notification appears: *"D-Link device discovered"*
2. Click the notification or go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
3. You'll see the discovered device — click **Configure**
4. Enter the **Username** and **PIN code** (password)
5. Click **Submit** to complete setup

### Options

After a device is configured, you can adjust settings without restarting:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find the **D-Link HNAP** integration and click **Configure**
3. Adjust the options:

| Option | Default | Range | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| **Update interval** | 30 seconds | 5–300 seconds | How frequently the device is polled for new data. Lower values give faster updates but increase network traffic. |
| **Motion timeout** | 30 seconds | 5–600 seconds | How long after the last detected motion before the motion sensor entity turns `off`. Only relevant for motion-capable devices. |

4. Click **Submit** — changes take effect immediately (the integration reloads automatically)

## Legacy YAML Configuration *(deprecated)*

> ⚠️ **YAML configuration is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.**
> Existing YAML configurations are **automatically migrated** to UI config entries on the next restart.
> After migration, you can safely remove the `dlink_hnap` entries from your `configuration.yaml`.

The legacy YAML format is shown below for reference only:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: dlink_hnap
    name: Kitchen Motion
    host: 10.0.0.10
    type: motion
    username: Admin
    password: 123456
    timeout: 35
  - platform: dlink_hnap
    name: Kitchen Leakage
    host: 10.0.0.11
    type: water
    username: Admin
    password: 123456
```

<details>
<summary>Legacy YAML configuration options</summary>

| Key | Required | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | -------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `name` | No | string | `D-Link Motion Sensor` | Name for the sensor |
| `type` | **Yes** | string | | Sensor type: `motion` or `water` |
| `host` | **Yes** | string | | IP address of the device |
| `username` | No | string | `Admin` | Username for authentication |
| `password` | **Yes** | string | | PIN code printed on the device |
| `timeout` | No | int | `35` | Seconds before motion sensor turns `off` after last trigger (motion only) |

</details>

## Diagnostics

This integration supports Home Assistant's built-in diagnostics feature:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **D-Link HNAP**
2. Click on the device
3. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) → **Download diagnostics**

The diagnostics file includes:
- Configuration entry data (with password redacted)
- Configured options (scan interval, motion timeout)
- Detected device capabilities
- Current device data (with serial number redacted)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| **"Failed to connect"** during setup | Verify the IP address is correct and the device is powered on and reachable. Try pinging the device. |
| **"Invalid username or password"** | The password is the numeric PIN code on the device label, not a user-chosen password. Username is almost always `Admin`. |
| **Entities not appearing** | The integration only creates entities for capabilities the device reports. Check diagnostics to see detected capabilities. |
| **Motion sensor stuck on** | Increase the motion timeout in Options. The sensor turns `off` only after no motion is detected for the configured timeout period. |
| **Stale data / slow updates** | Decrease the scan interval in Options (minimum 5 seconds). Note that very low values increase network traffic. |
| **Device becomes unavailable** | The device may have changed IP address. Delete and re-add the integration with the new IP, or assign a static IP/DHCP reservation. |

## How It Works

This integration communicates with D-Link devices using the **HNAP** (Home Network Administration Protocol) over SOAP/HTTP. The protocol flow is:

1. **Authentication** — A challenge-response handshake using HMAC-MD5, establishing a session cookie
2. **Capability detection** — Queries the device's supported SOAP actions to determine which sensors are available
3. **Polling** — Periodically fetches sensor data (water state, motion events, temperature) based on detected capabilities

All communication happens locally on your network. No data is sent to the cloud.

## Resolved Issues

Version 2.0.0 addresses the following open issues:

| Issue | Description | How it's resolved |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| [#18](https://github.com/postlund/dlink_hnap/issues/18) | 2025.1.b5 failed to load sensor | Removed deprecated `DEVICE_CLASS_MOTION` / `DEVICE_CLASS_MOISTURE` imports; fully rewritten with modern `BinarySensorDeviceClass` enums |
| [#21](https://github.com/postlund/dlink_hnap/issues/21) | DLink HNAP issues with HA 2025.2.x | Complete rewrite resolves all compatibility issues with modern Home Assistant |
| [#12](https://github.com/postlund/dlink_hnap/issues/12) | Excessive errors when device is in power-saving mode | `DataUpdateCoordinator` rate-limits error logging; proper `CannotConnect` → `UpdateFailed` handling avoids log spam; configurable scan interval reduces poll frequency |
| [#17](https://github.com/postlund/dlink_hnap/issues/17) | No device health / offline indication | `DataUpdateCoordinator` automatically marks entities as **unavailable** when the device can't be reached — standard HA device health pattern |
| [#20](https://github.com/postlund/dlink_hnap/issues/20) | DCH-S162 not working | Automatic capability detection probes each device's SOAP actions, so any HNAP-compatible device should work. *(Note: The DCH-S162 may use a different protocol — cannot verify without hardware)* |

Not yet addressed: [#11](https://github.com/postlund/dlink_hnap/issues/11) (Battery attribute) — The SOAP action name for battery state is unknown. Contributions from users with battery-powered devices (DCH-S161) are welcome.
